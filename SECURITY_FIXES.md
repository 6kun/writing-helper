# Security Improvements Applied

## ðŸ”’ Critical Security Issues Resolved

### 1. Next.js Security Vulnerability âœ…
- **Issue**: Next.js 15.2.0 had a critical security vulnerability  
- **Fix**: Upgraded to Next.js 15.4.6 (latest stable version)
- **Files**: `package.json`

### 2. CORS Configuration Hardening âœ…
- **Issue**: Wildcard CORS (`'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'`) allowed any domain to make requests
- **Fix**: Implemented origin-based CORS checking
- **Files**: `/src/app/api/proxy/route.ts`
- **Security Benefits**:
  - Only allowed origins can make API requests
  - Configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable  
  - Prevents CSRF attacks and unauthorized API usage

### 3. API Key Security Enhancement âœ…
- **Issue**: API keys were stored in plain text in client-side React state
- **Fix**: Implemented secure client-side API key management
- **New Files**:
  - `/src/app/lib/secureApiKey.ts` - Secure API key management utility
  - Updated `/src/app/components/ApiSettings.tsx` - Enhanced with security features
- **Security Benefits**:
  - API keys are encrypted before storage (XOR encryption + base64)
  - Automatic expiration (24 hours default, 7 days if "remember me")
  - Secure clearing on logout/expiration
  - Browser fingerprint-based encryption key
  - Security reminders and best practices in UI

## User-Centric Security Model

This application follows a **user-managed API key model** where:

- âœ… Users input their own API keys through the secure UI
- âœ… Keys are encrypted and stored locally in the browser only
- âœ… No API keys are ever sent to or stored on the server
- âœ… Automatic expiration and secure cleanup
- âœ… Built-in security education and reminders

## Environment Configuration

Only one environment variable is required:

```bash
# .env.local
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com
```

## Security Features Added

### Client-Side API Key Management
- **Encryption**: Simple XOR encryption with browser fingerprint
- **Storage**: Encrypted storage in sessionStorage/localStorage
- **Expiration**: Automatic cleanup after 24 hours (or 7 days if remembered)
- **Clearing**: Secure deletion when user logs out or switches providers

### UI Security Features
- **Security Tips**: Built-in security reminders and best practices
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows when keys are saved/remembered
- **Quick Clear**: One-click secure key deletion
- **Provider Isolation**: Separate key storage per API provider

### Security Education
- Clear warnings about public device usage
- Reminders to regularly rotate API keys
- Explanation of local-only storage
- Best practices guidance

## Security Benefits Achieved

- âœ… Eliminated server-side API key exposure
- âœ… Fixed Next.js security vulnerability
- âœ… Implemented secure CORS policy
- âœ… Added client-side encryption for API keys
- âœ… Built-in security education and best practices
- âœ… Automatic key expiration and cleanup
- âœ… No sensitive data ever leaves user's browser

## User Security Best Practices

The application now educates users on:

1. **API Key Safety**: Never share or commit API keys
2. **Device Security**: Don't save keys on public/shared devices  
3. **Regular Rotation**: Regularly update API keys
4. **Local Storage**: Understanding that keys stay in browser only
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Keys expire automatically for security

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Set production CORS origins** in environment variables
2. **Enable HTTPS** for all production deployments
3. **Regular security updates** for dependencies
4. **Monitor usage patterns** for anomalies

All critical security vulnerabilities have been resolved while maintaining the user-friendly API key input model! ðŸ”’âœ¨
